## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional working environment üë©üèª‚Äçüíª. 

- I created a brand identity, including name, logo and colour palette.

- I separated each requirement into sub-tasks.

- I wrote tidy and reusable code, separated components into folders and commented out sections that required it.

## How to navigate through this project: its most interesting parts

Validation of the purchase form: [Code](https://github.com/OrnellaGrigolato/Siami_WaterPark/blob/6080d7c79efe2eb827ed070951a825c95bff67e6/src/Components/Cart/Cart.js#L112)

The Context: [Code](https://github.com/OrnellaGrigolato/Siami_WaterPark/blob/6080d7c79efe2eb827ed070951a825c95bff67e6/src/Context/CartContext.js#L4)

## Why I built the project this way ‚ùî
This project required a library like React because of its benefits. React allowed me to create reusable components, saving me time and effort. It also makes maintaining a project of this size much easier.
The use of State and Context made it easy for me to manage and update information. 
React Router helped me create the routing for this application, it made filtering the different products much easier to develop.
Storing the product information in Firebase reduced the load on the project and improved performance.

<br/>

## What else would I add to this project? üöÄ

* Ability to view purchase history by storing information in Local Storage or Firebase.
* Administrator interface, to add/remove/modify products as required and facilitate maintenance.
* The ability to register to create a blog to share photos, comments and opinions.
